# NetworkSecurityPacketTracer

In this project, I designed a network for a client where I consulted appropriate robust network design models to meet the design requirements. I also implemented Access Control Lists and Virtual Private Network(VPN) to enable secure communication considering security and network performance factors paramount to safeguard Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of data and communication.
